## React Ivandjoh

### About
The purpose of this `Repository` was made was just for learning `ReactJS`, although i am not `frontend developer`, but I feel that there is nothing wrong to learning ReactJS, so what do we learn?


### The Basics
Here are the `topics` that i take :

- `JSX`
- `Component`
- `Props`
- `Ternary Operators`
- `CSS Modules`

| Title | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `JSX` | `JSX` is a React extension to the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. |
| `Component` | `Components` are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. |
| `Props` | `Props` are arguments passed into React components. |
| `Ternary Operators` | The `Ternary Operator` is a simplified conditional operator like `if` / `else`. |
| `CSS Modules` | `CSS Modules`  is a great approach for making CSS locally scoped and for preventing naming clashes in medium to large projects. |
