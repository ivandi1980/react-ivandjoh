## REACT IVANDJOH

### About
The purpose of this `Repository` was made was just for learning `ReactJS`, although i am not `frontend developer`, but I feel that there is nothing wrong to learning ReactJS, so what do we learn?

Here are the Steps that i take :

- `JSX, Component & Props`

| Title | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| `JSX` | `JSX` is a React extension to the JavaScript language syntax which provides a way to structure component rendering using syntax familiar to many developers. |
| `Component` | `Components` are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML. |
| `Props` | `Props` are arguments passed into React components. |
